# Mycoding_exercises & mini-projects
Here I solve exercises and try out some beginner projects. Some notable ones are
- **Leap_it.py**: checks if a year is a leap year or not.
- **password_picker2.py**: 2 because the first version automatically created passwords with already inputed words but this one gives you 2 options, either to automatically generate the password or to customize the passwords.
- **temp_converter.py**: Converts temperature from fahrenheit to celsius.
